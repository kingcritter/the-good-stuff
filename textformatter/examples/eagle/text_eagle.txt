            mankind requires that the                        y should declare th                       e causes which impel them            
          to the separation.  We hold                        these truths to be                       self-evident, that all men a          
         re created equal, that they are                     endowed by their Cre                   ator with certain unalienable R         
        ights, that among these are Life,                    Liberty and the pursu                 it of Happiness. — That to secure        
        these rights, Governments are insti                tuted among Men, derivi               ng their just powers from the consen       
       t of the governed, — That whenever any              Form of Government becom            es destructive of these ends, it is th       
      e Right of the People to alter or to aboli         sh it, and to institute new         Government, laying its foundation on such      
      principles and organizing its powers in such fo   rm, as to them shall seem mo   st likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.      
     Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordi     
    ngly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abol    
    ishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object     
   evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to pr   
   ovide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity wh   
  ich constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeat  
  ed injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let   
  Facts be submitted to a candid world.  He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.  He has   
 forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be o 
 btained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.  He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of la 
 rge districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them  
and for  midable to tyrants only.  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the   deposi
t            ory  of their Public Records, for the sole  purpose of fatiguing them  into compliance with his measures.  He  has             
                     dissolved Representative Houses rep  eatedly, for opposing wi  th manly firmness his invasions on                      
                     the  rights of the people.  He has   refused for a long time,    after such dissolutions, to  caus
